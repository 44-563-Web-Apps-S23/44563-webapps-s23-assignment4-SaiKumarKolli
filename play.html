    <p>
        LUKE. [_Off stage._] It's all right, boys.... Jist leave him to me....
    Git in there, Mister Revenue.

     [REVENUE, _a Northerner in city attire, without hat, clothes dusty,
     is pushed through doorway_. LUKE, _a lanky, ill-dressed Southerner,
     following, closes door_. REVENUE'S _hands are tied behind him_.

    LUKE. You must excuse the boys for makin' a demonstration over you,
    Mister Revenue, but you see they don't come across you fellers very
    frequent, and they allus gits excited.

    REVENUE. I appreciate that I'm welcome.

    LUKE. 'Deed you is, and I'm just agoin' to untie your hands long nuff
    fer you to take a sociable drink. [_Goes to stranger, feels in
    all-pockets for weapons._] Reckon yer travellin' peaceable. [_Unties
    hands._] Won't yer sit down?

    REVENUE. [_Drawing over chair and sitting._] Thank you. [_Rubs wrists to
    get back circulation._]

    LUKE. [_Going over to cupboard and taking out jug._] Yessa, Mister, the
    boys ain't seen one o' you fellers fer near two years. Began to think
    you wus goin' to neglect us. I wus hopin' you might be Jim Dunn. Have a
    drink?

    REVENUE. [_Starts slightly at mention of_ JIM DUNN.] No, thank you, your
    make is too strong for me.

    LUKE. It hain't no luck to drink alone when you git company. Better have
    some.

    REVENUE. Very well, my friend, I suffer willingly.

     [_Drinks a little and chokes._

    LUKE. [_Draining cup._] I reckon ye all don't like the flavor of liquor
    that hain't been stamped.

    REVENUE. It's not so bad.

    LUKE. The last Revenue that sit in that chair got drunk on my make.

    REVENUE. That wouldn't be difficult.

    LUKE. No, but it wuz awkward.

    REVENUE. Why?

    LUKE. I had to wait till he sobered up before I give him his ticker. I
    didn't feel like sendin' him to heaven drunk. He'd a found it awkward
    climbin' that golden ladder.

    REVENUE. Thoughtful executioner.

    LUKE. So you see mebbe you kin delay things a little by dallyin' with
    the licker.

    REVENUE. [_Picking up cup, getting it as far as his lips, slowly puts it
    down._] The price is too great.

    LUKE. I'm mighty sorry you ain't Jim Dunn. But I reckon you ain't. You
    don't answer his likeness.

    REVENUE. Who's Jim Dunn?

    LUKE. You ought to know who Jim Dunn is. He's just about the worst one
    of your revenue critters that ever hit these parts. He's got four of the
    boys in jail. We got a little reception all ready for him. See that?

     [_Pointing to sketch on back wall._

    REVENUE. [_Looking at sketch._] Yes.

    LUKE. That's Jim Dunn.

    REVENUE. [_Rising, examining picture._] Doesn't look much like any one.


    LUKE. Well, that's what Jim Dunn'll look like when we git 'im. I'm
    mighty sorry you hain't Jim Dunn.

    REVENUE. I'm sorry to disappoint you.
